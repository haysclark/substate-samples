Quake sample for Substate
=========================

A Quake themed example based on [ID's FiniteStateMachines article](http://ai-depot.com/FiniteStateMachines/FSM.html).


Installation
------------
You can create it using the "create" command:

    lime create substate

This will create a copy of the sample within the current directory, using the same name as the sample. If you prefer, you can also specify a custom target directory:

    lime create substate:Quake SubstateTest
